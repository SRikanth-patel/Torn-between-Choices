        <h1>Torn Between Choices</h1>

        <pre>
The sun was setting, casting a warm, golden light through the leaves of the tree overhead. Rachel and Akshay sat quietly on a bench, deep in the shade, the world around them calm and peaceful. The gentle rustle of leaves was the only sound that filled the air, providing a quiet backdrop to their intense conversation.

Akshay broke the silence. "Are you free to talk?"

Rachel nodded slowly, her eyes distant as she gazed at the ground. "Yeah, I’m free. What’s up?"

Akshay leaned forward slightly, his voice steady but serious. "You know what? Sidhharth just called me 25 times."

Rachel exhaled deeply, rubbing her forehead. "I told him already to leave. I don’t want to continue this. I’m not feeling good about this."

Akshay, sensing the weight of the situation, looked at her with concern. "What happened? You both were fine a few days ago. Why this sudden, big decision?"

Rachel shook her head, her voice trembling. "Nothing. I don’t want anything. I’m just living for my parents only."

She took a moment, then added, "Tell him not to drag this."

Akshay gave a small nod, but he still had questions. "Okay, I’ll tell him. But I need some clarity from you. Just give me a little insight."

Rachel’s gaze met his. "Okay, what is it?"

Akshay asked, "Does your family live for their parents, or live with their parents?"

Rachel took a deep breath, reflecting on her parents' relationship. "After a few years of marriage, my parents and we (my brother and I) will live separately. My mom goes to her parents for festivals and functions. My dad’s parents died. Whatever he does, it’s all for my mom. He’s just living for her, and my mom is living for us."

Akshay nodded, processing her words. "Look, in your family, take your mom, for example. What does she have? Just children to love, and a good husband to be loved by."

Rachel’s thoughts wandered for a moment, but she stayed focused. Akshay continued, his voice soft but pointed. "One day, we’ll have to live without or away from our parents, like they’re not living with their parents. It’ll be that way for us too."

Rachel looked at him, understanding his words but still uncertain. "Yeah, that’s true. But what do you want to tell me? What clarification do you need?"

Akshay sat back, folding his arms as he spoke thoughtfully. "Life is like a piece of paper. On one side, you have your parents and family life. But on the other side, you’ll have to become a parent yourself and create your own family, just like your parents are doing now."

Rachel’s brow furrowed, feeling torn. "But whatever happens, at the end of the day, my parents will show me a guy, and I’ll marry him. I can’t do anything about it. I just want their happiness, and I’m living for them."

Akshay sighed, but his tone was firm, yet caring. "No, you can do something. But think about this: You’re going to live a compromised life with a guy you don’t even know. Here, though, the thing is different. Sidhharth loves you a lot. I know that. And you love him too, but you’ve never admitted it."

Rachel's voice faltered as she tried to keep things simple. "You’re my friend first. You should support my decisions."

Akshay’s eyes met hers, unwavering. "I’m not the kind of friend who just supports your stupid decisions. I’m the kind of friend who wants you to live a happy life. I’ll oppose any decisions that will affect your permanent happiness, even if they give you temporary relief."

Rachel shook her head, feeling overwhelmed. "I don’t know... My heart isn’t convincing me to continue all this drama. I’d rather be happy without any of this. I feel like I’m cheating my parents. With that guilt, I can’t live."

Akshay chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. "Hahaha. If this small thing, for the rest of your life, is making you feel like this, then think about marrying someone you don’t know. And realize you’ll have no other choice but to live with that person."

Rachel frowned, uncertain about his words. Akshay looked at her earnestly. "You know why God gives these kinds of situations in life?"

Rachel’s mind was clouded with confusion. "You know everything, right? Why don’t you tell me why?"

Akshay leaned in, his voice calm and thoughtful. "God is testing how much you’re willing to endure for the person you want in your life. You have to think maturely and handle situations like this. Everyone faces similar problems. Whoever is capable of handling these challenges will end up with the person they truly want. The ones who leave in the middle will spend the rest of their lives with regret, thinking, ‘I should have done things differently.’"

Rachel sat quietly, her thoughts racing. "But anyway, how will everyone think if this all comes out? I’ve already faced difficult situations in my past. What will my mom think about me? I’ll lose her trust."

Akshay smiled gently, his tone reassuring. "Whatever you do, people will always talk behind your back. So live life for yourself. And about your parents, how would they know, other than from you? You can decide how to maintain it, when to reveal things, and how to handle it. That’s all up to you. In every relationship, people have to figure it out. Even if they know, Sidhharth is a good guy. Your parents like him. He’s patient enough to bear all of your tantrums," he added with a laugh. "And he’s intelligent enough to solve your problems. We both know he’ll do everything for you. He’s perfect for you."

Rachel nodded slowly, processing his words, but still feeling unsure. "What you’re saying makes sense, and it’s making me think... but..."

Akshay leaned forward, his voice more urgent now. "Again, but what? If we don’t stand by the person we want, how can he fight this battle alone? Trust me, everything will be alright. Just call him and talk to him. These problems will always come in every relationship. Think about how you can solve them with him, instead of letting them push him out of your life."

Rachel’s heart was heavy with doubt, but she felt something shift within her. "Now I’m feeling regret. How stupid I am. I don’t know how you think this deeply."

Akshay smiled softly, his voice growing gentler. "I’ve been through a lot in my life. I don’t want anyone’s life to end up like mine."

Rachel sat quietly, the weight of his words sinking in. She knew she had some hard decisions ahead, but for the first time, she felt a glimmer of hope—maybe she didn’t have to choose between her happiness and her family’s wishes. Maybe there was a way forward, if only she could find the courage to take it.
